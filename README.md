# About Event Manager application

This application contains all your college events, you can register for event and eventCreators can host their event.

## Why built this app?

This project is special for me. This is my College Major Project. I got the idea from the scenario where students going class to class to inform students about the event and take their name. I want to digitalize this method.

## Future modification Ideas
- error handling with alerts are not properly done  
- Date filter for todays and upcoming events
- Number of users registered for event - need to show this detail in card.
- I can sort events based on the popularity = number of users register for a event.
- On Demand Volunteer needed option in card.
- Future component work - Placement events and status
- Event review or feedback box need to be added for user  
- Past events queue there i will add this feedback functionality.
- Download list of users that are registered in events.
